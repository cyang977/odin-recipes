    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This recipe originated from South East Asia. <strong><em>Pho</em></strong> is a rice noodle
        dish topped with vegatables and various choices of protein. Its broth is
        beef based and can be made with beef paste, herbs, and spices. You can also
        use chicken broth in placement of beef based broth. This dish has evolved 
        over the years and have recently gotten more popular in the U.S. Condiments
        can be added to "flavor" the broth to your taste. This recipe is a basic revision of 
        this dish.
